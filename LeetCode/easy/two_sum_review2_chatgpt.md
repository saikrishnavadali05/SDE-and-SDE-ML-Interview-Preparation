How is my solution ?

```python
print(f"nums : {nums}")
        
hashmap = {} 
result = []

for ele_idx, ele in enumerate(nums, start=0):
    print(f"hashmap : {hashmap}")
    hashmap[ele] = ele_idx

    complement = target - ele    

    if complement in hashmap and hashmap[complement] != '':
        return [hashmap[ele], hashmap[complement]]

    hashmap[complement] = ''

    if ele == complement:
        hashmap[complement] = ele_idx

return None
```



Your solution to the 2-sum problem using a hash map demonstrates a good understanding of using auxiliary data structures for optimizing searches. However, there are a few issues and inefficiencies in the code that can lead to incorrect results or reduced performance. Hereâ€™s a review and suggestions for improvement:

### Code Review and Issues

1. **Updating `hashmap` During Iteration**: You are updating the `hashmap` for both the element and its complement within the same iteration. This can lead to incorrect results because you may overwrite values or references to indices that are needed for the solution. In a typical 2-sum implementation using a hash map, you should only add an element to the hash map after checking for its complement.

2. **Conditional Check for the Complement**: The condition `if complement in hashmap and hashmap[complement] != '':` is partially redundant because you're using a placeholder `''` (an empty string). Instead, you should check for the existence of the complement before updating the hash map with the current element.

3. **Unnecessary Placeholder**: Using an empty string `''` as a placeholder for `hashmap[complement]` complicates the logic unnecessarily and could lead to errors or misuse of index values.

4. **Handling of Duplicates**: The logic to handle cases where the element is equal to its complement (like in the input `[2, 2]` with `target = 4`) is not immediately clear or may not function correctly as intended due to the use of placeholder and subsequent overwriting.

5. **Return Type Inconsistency**: Returning `None` when no solution is found is fine, but typically in LeetCode problems like this, returning an empty list `[]` is more consistent. This ensures the return type is always a list.

### Improved Solution

Here's a refined version of your approach, simplifying the logic and ensuring correct handling of edge cases:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in hashmap:
                return [hashmap[complement], index]
            hashmap[num] = index  # Update the hashmap after checking for the complement
        return []
```

### Key Changes

- **Direct Check for Complement**: The check for the complement is done before the element itself is added to the hash map. This ensures that no element can pair with itself unless its exact value has appeared previously in the list.
- **No Placeholder**: The use of placeholders is removed to avoid any confusion and potential bugs. This simplifies the code significantly.
- **Simplified Logic**: The code directly returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target, once found.

This updated approach adheres to the optimal \(O(n)\) time complexity and ensures correct handling of all possible cases by focusing on the essential steps of the hash map method for the 2-sum problem.
