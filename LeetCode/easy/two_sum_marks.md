If I were to evaluate your code out of 10, I would give it around a 4. Here's a breakdown of my assessment:

1. **Correctness (2/4)**: The intent of solving the problem is clear, and you've included some necessary checks. However, there are several logical issues that affect correctness, such as the use of bitwise operations instead of logical ones and an incorrect implementation of inner loop indices that skips potential valid pairs.

2. **Efficiency (1/3)**: The approach used (nested loops) results in a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large inputs allowed by your constraints (up to 10,000 elements). A more efficient approach using hash maps would significantly reduce the time complexity to O(n).

3. **Style and Best Practices (1/3)**: The code includes comments and checks, which is good practice, but it could be improved in readability and efficiency. The use of `sys.exit(0)` within a function is not typical for this kind of problem and might be considered a bad practice in this context.

Improvements can focus on correctness, efficiency, and best practices, especially using appropriate data structures and error handling. Keep practicing and refining your approachâ€”it's a great way to learn and improve your coding skills!
