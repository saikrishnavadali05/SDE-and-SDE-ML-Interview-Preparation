# ================================================================
# On a scale of 10, I would give your code a 5. Here's the breakdown of the assessment:

# Understanding the Problem (7/10): You understood the problem and attempted to find the maximum profit by comparing prices. However, the solution can be optimized.

# Implementation (4/10): Your code works in terms of logic for comparing prices and calculating profit differences, but it uses nested loops which makes it inefficient for large inputs.

# Efficiency (3/10): The nested loops result in 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# 2
# )
# O(n 
# 2
#  ) time complexity, which is not optimal. The problem can be solved in 
# 𝑂
# (
# 𝑛
# )
# O(n) time complexity using a more efficient approach.

# Clarity and Simplicity (6/10): Your code is fairly clear and you have included comments. However, there's some commented-out code which might make it a bit confusing. Simplifying the logic and removing unnecessary parts would improve clarity.

# Correctness (5/10): The code attempts to find the maximum profit correctly, but the inefficiency and overcomplication make it less practical for larger inputs.

# Suggestions for Improvement:
# Focus on optimizing the solution for better time complexity.
# Simplify the logic to make the code easier to read and maintain.
# Remove any commented-out code that isn't necessary for the final solution.
# Keep practicing and refining your approach to problem-solving, and you'll continue to improve!
