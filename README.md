#### Famous usecases to start with

1. Housing price prediction problem
2. Iris Dataset - identify the flower based on sepal length and sepal width.
3. Try to apply reverse engineering on the usecases

#### IDEs
1. PyCharm
2. Jupyter
3. Spyder
4. VS Code
5. RStudio (for R programming)

#### Web Scraping 
1. Beautiful Soup 
2. scrapy
3. urllib

#### how I would learn data science if I had to start again :

1.	Programming in either Python or R 
  a.	prefer Python for Jobs.
  b.	R for Scientific and Academic purposes.
  c.	Python is a bit more versatile

2.	have a very basic understanding of statistics 
3.	Basic foundational knowledge of data science core subjects
4.	doing real-world projects is the most effective way to grasp this field 
5.	You should learn just enough programming and statistics to explore your own projects 
6.	knowledge through very introductory online courses
a.	like the micro courses on Kaggle 
b.	365 data science
7.	Kaggle is the best as they have large amounts of datasets and also has analysis for all the projects
8.	Kaggle is a public forum for people to submit their analysis of shared data sets 
9.	We can see the code of established data scientists
10.	From this you can see what packages they used the way that they explore the data 
11.	the different ways that they optimize the algorithms that they use 
12.	follow along with a few more of these advanced notebooks 
13.	then I would recommend you starting on your own basic projects 
14.	I made a video about the three beginner projects that I recommend and
15.	Split your time about 50/50 between working on your own projects and  other people's code 
16.	Of the new things that I saw in these more advanced workbooks to the code that
17.	Along learning this way you'll see when different people use algorithms and different packages
18.	I recommend compiling a list of all the different things you see you should go
19.	through the source code of all these different things and try to grasp how they're constructed 
20.	frankly if you can understand the source code for an algorithm you functionally understand 
21.	the math behind it is still good to supplement this information with some actual theory using Wikipedia or some math textbooks but that will give you only theoretical knowledge behind the logic actually implemented.
