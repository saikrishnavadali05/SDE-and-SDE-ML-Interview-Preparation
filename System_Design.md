> ABCD of System Design
* A - Always ask good questions
* B - Buzz Words NO NO NO (Don't use words without proper knowledge or which you found out by quick researching for 10 minutes the previous day) 
* C - Clear and Organized Thinking
* D - Drive Discussions (80 myself - 20 interviewr should speak Rule)

> Must know concepts for System Design Questions
1. CAP Theory -> Consistency - Availability - Partition Tolerance
   * Difference between SQL and NoSQL Databases (Which Database chooses what? over the above 3 (CAP))?
2. Vertical Scaling (Increasing System Resources like Memory RAM, etc) or Horizontal Scaling (Increasing Number of Hosts - Making Distributed System)
3. acid vs base database
4. Partitioning or Sharding of Data (What is Consistent Hashing)
5. Optimisstic Vs Pessimistic Locking in databases
6. Strong vs Eventual Consistency
7. Relational DB (follows ACID) vs NoSQL
8. Types of NoSQL Databases
  * Key-Value Pair
  * Wide Column
  * Document based
  * Graph Based
9. Caching 
10. Data Centers, Racks and Hosts
11. CPU, Memory, Harddrive, Network Bandwidth
12. Random vs Sequential Read/Write on Disk
13. Http / Https vs WebSockets
14.
